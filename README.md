## Installation

If you'd like to play around with the source code you can do it with the following:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
3. Create a .env file with the following variables:

```
PORT = Your backend port (server defaults to 5000)
SMTP_USER = The email account that will SEND the email
SMTP_PASS = The password that will SEND the email
SMTP_RECEIVER_EMAIL = The account that RECEIVES email
```

4. You can access both front end and back end at the same time by running `cd client` followed by `npm run condev`, which uses concurrently to run both simultaneously.

## Technologies
