## Installation

If you'd like to play around with the source code you can do it with the following:
1.) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.) Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
3.) You can access both front end and back end at the same time by running `cd client` followed by `npm run condev`, which uses concurrently to run both simultaneously.
4.) Happy coding!
